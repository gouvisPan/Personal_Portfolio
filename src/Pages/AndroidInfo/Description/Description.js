    " application was handled as an actual business project and all the major" +

    " verbal descriptions of each use case were used in order to complete the" +
    " domain model and subsequently the class diagram of the application." +

    " layering scheme proposal were used and analyzed. During the development" +

    " most popular Android Libraries like Room, Gson, JetBrains-Coroutines as" +
